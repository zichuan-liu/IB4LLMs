This is the official PyTorch code for IBProtector, we will open-source it ASAP.

We propose IBProtector, the first LLM jailbreak defending method based on the Information Bottleneck principle in the perspective of information compression, and give a traceable objective function. The method is lightweight and requires no modifications to the LLMs. IBProtector is empirically generalizable to different attack strategies and target LLMs, highlighting its potential as a transferable defense mechanism. We evaluate IBProtector on token-level and prompt-level jailbreaking datasets. The results show that IBProtector can successfully defend against adversarial prompts without substantially affecting LLMsâ€™ responsiveness and inference consumption.
